## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/KossaiSbai/sdv-kossai-sbai/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### *Introduction
The purpose of this proposal is to provide a data visualisation that will give a better insight on European football, in particular be able to assess teams performances. In fact, football is a low- scoring sport: the overall average number of goals scored per game at the FIFA World Cups between 1930 and 2018, is 3.08. This shows us that we cannot evaluate a teams’ performance on the number of goals scored. It is important to be able to judge how well a team did on given games: it enables the club to improve team strategies and hopefully increase number of won games. 
Therefore, we can ask ourselves: what are appropriate metrics to use in order to get a reliable measure of the performance of a team? Can analysing the game style of a team help us explain why it might have done better/worse on a given season/game? 

The dataset [1] that will be used, in order to answer those questions contains statistical summary data by the end of each season from 2014 for 6 UEFA Leagues: La Liga, Ligue 1, EPL, Bundesliga, Serie A and RFPL. It is made up of two CSV files: the first one displays summary data per season for all the teams whereas the second one displays similar data per game for all the teams.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/KossaiSbai/sdv-kossai-sbai/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
